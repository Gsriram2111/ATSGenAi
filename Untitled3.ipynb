            "1.  **Programming Languages (Excellent Match):**\n",
            "    *   **Keywords:** C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript (ES6+).\n",
            "    *   **Resume Match:** All explicitly listed under \"Programming Languages\" and demonstrated in projects. Python (Django) and JavaScript (React.js, Node.js) are key full-stack languages you possess.\n",

            "2.  **Frontend Development (Excellent Match):**\n",
            "    *   **Keywords:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Responsive Design, UI/UX (implied).\n",
            "    *   **Resume Match:** All explicitly listed. React.js and Tailwind CSS are modern, in-demand frontend technologies, and your projects (CrizScore, Movie Search) clearly showcase their application and responsive UI design.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Backend & APIs (Strong Match):**\n",
            "    *   **Keywords:** Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), RESTful APIs, Backend development.\n",
            "    *   **Resume Match:** Node.js and RESTful APIs are explicitly listed. Django (Python framework) is prominently featured in your \"Social Media Web Application\" project, demonstrating strong backend capabilities, including user authentication and CRUD operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Databases (Strong Match):**\n",
            "    *   **Keywords:** MySQL, MongoDB, SQL, NoSQL.\n",
            "    *   **Resume Match:** MySQL and MongoDB are explicitly listed. SQLite is also mentioned in a project, showing versatility.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Core CS (Excellent Match):**\n",

            "    *   **Resume Match:** All explicitly listed. These are fundamental for any strong developer role.\n",

            "7.  **Projects (Outstanding Validation):**\n",
            "    *   Your three projects are **highly relevant** and demonstrate full-stack capabilities, API integration, UI development, and database interactions. They are your strongest asset in an ATS context.\n",
            "    *   \"Social Media Web Application\" directly covers backend (Django, SQLite, auth, CRUD).\n",
            "    *   \"CrizScore\" and \"Movie Search\" strongly showcase frontend (React, Tailwind) with API integration, which is a core full-stack skill.\n",

            "8.  **Certifications (Strong Plus):**\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **Testing Frameworks:** While not always required for entry-level, mentioning experience with testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library for frontend; Pytest for Python; Mocha/Chai for Node.js) would significantly boost your score for more advanced roles.\n",
            "2.  **Deployment/DevOps:** You have AWS, which is a great start. Explicitly mentioning experience with deploying applications (e.g., to AWS EC2, Netlify, Vercel, Heroku) or basic CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) concepts would be beneficial.\n",
            "3.  **Containerization:** Familiarity with Docker is a common requirement for full-stack roles now.\n",
            "4.  **Specific Backend Frameworks:** While you listed Node.js, specifying if you've worked with popular Node.js frameworks like Express.js would add more weight.\n",
            "5.  **Quantifiable Impact:** Where possible, try to quantify achievements in your projects (e.g., \"Improved load time by X%,\" \"Handled Y concurrent users,\" \"Reduced database query time by Z\"). This is harder for personal projects but impactful.\n",
            "6.  **Keywords in Experience:** Your AI & Machine Learning internship, while showcasing technical skills, is not directly \"full stack.\" If the job description specifically mentions AI/ML, it's a perfect match. Otherwise, ensure you highlight *transferable skills* from this experience that are relevant to software development (e.g., problem-solving, algorithm implementation, prototype development).\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
